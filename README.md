# Allstate_Claims_Severity
This repository contains my work and insights on the Allstate Claims Severity Kaggle competition, which focuses on predicting the loss value associated with insurance claims.

#### Key Highlights:

- **Objective**: To develop predictive models that estimate the cost of claims, optimizing accuracy while managing overfitting and feature complexity.
- **Data**: Anonymized tabular data with categorical and continuous variables representing various factors affecting claims severity.
- Approach:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering for categorical and continuous data.
  - Exploration of ensemble learning techniques, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest.
  - Evaluation using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to align with the competition objectives.
- Tools & Technologies:
  - Python for data manipulation, visualization, and model development.
  - Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Results:
  - Achieved a competitive performance on the Kaggle leaderboard.
  - Shared reproducible notebooks and scripts for ease of understanding and collaboration.
